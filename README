World of Warcraft DBC Library
Copyright (c) 2011 Tim Kurvers <http://www.moonsphere.net>

This library allows creation, reading and export of World of Warcraft's
client-side database files. These so-called DBCs store information
required by the client to operate successfully and can be extracted
from the MPQ archives of the actual game client.

Required PHP version: 5.x

Directory structure:

	/examples/
		/dbcs/
		/export/
		/maps/
	/lib/
		/exporters/
	/LICENSE
	/README

This file will hopefully be expanded in the future ^.^
